# Typeracer-bot
Javascript bot to print the exact same sentences as in the question


1. In the JS, update the line 21 with the updated class name of the race, and paste it into browser console
2. Spam space button once race starts.


Note: Be careful not to cross the WPM limit of 100 or else you will have to pass a test by typing at the same speed using a captcha. I could manage a speed of 105 WPM on the test, so now I can use this bot to hit WPM of around 132 all the time.
